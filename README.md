Ideally **Brandon _the Builder_** (shout out to [ASOIF].. thanks GRRM)  
Which is just to tell you what was *inspiring* me at the time I wrote this

## Reason for doing this:
Was meaning to do this for a while.. wanted to be able to boilerplate and template a whole bunch of files and folders.
Came up with this YML based directory structure.. [see here for any doubts regarding Ruby YML Syntax][yml]


## Usage Guide:

```ruby
s = "Ruby syntax highlighting"
{one: 1, two: 2}
[1, 2, 3]
print s
```
Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3
